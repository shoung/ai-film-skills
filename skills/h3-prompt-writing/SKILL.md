name: h3-prompt-writing
description: Write MiniMax H3 video generation prompts for T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, and Ref2VA. Use when rewriting multimodal requests into H3 prompt structures, composing integrated_multimodal_description, overall_soundscape, and non_diegetic_music, aligning keyframes, or defining reference labels for images, videos, and audio.
compatibility: Portable to any agent that can read local files — no external API calls, MiniMax Hub tools, or proprietary runtime required. The agents/openai.yaml file only adds optional ChatGPT/Codex UI metadata; it does not restrict the skill to OpenAI agents.

# H3 Prompt Writing

## Workflow

1. Identify the input mode: T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, or full-reference Ref2VA.
2. For base text/keyframe modes, read `references/base-en.txt` and follow its final prompt structure.
3. For full-reference mode, read `references/ref-en.txt` and follow its six-section rewrite format.
4. Preserve the exact field names, section order, labels, and timing notation from the selected guide.
5. Before writing or revising character performance in any mode, read [Shared Performance Control](references/performance-control.md) in full. Apply it inside the existing shot description, not as a new top-level field. This same guide also applies to Seedance; it does not replace either model's format.

## Base Modes

- T2VA: build the full audiovisual timeline from text.
- I2VA: start from the first frame and develop forward from it.
- FL2VA: describe the continuous path between the first and last frames.
- L2VA: infer a plausible opening and converge to the supplied last frame.

Use `integrated_multimodal_description`, `overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music` in the order shown in `references/base-en.txt`.

## Full-Reference Mode

Ref2VA rewrites use `subject_definitions`, `summary`, `retention_analysis`, `detailed_description`, `overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music` in that order. Reference labels stay consistent across all sections.

Read `references/ref-en.txt` for label rules, retention analysis, and complete examples.

## Output Rules

- Write rewrite sections in English; preserve dialogue, lyrics, and visible scene text in their original language.
- Describe each shot by composition, subjects, environment, actions, camera, sound, and the exact point where referenced content appears.
- Avoid plot summaries, unresolved reference labels, and timing that does not match the requested duration.
- Build each performance beat from the character's objective and starting state through an exact dialogue word, physical event, visible change, or sound cue into breath/pause, observable facial/body response, and an ending state. State what must not react prematurely. Emotional labels alone are insufficient.
- For a shift of attention, let the eyes acquire the target before the head follows. Select readable eyelid, mouth, jaw, shoulder, or finger cues appropriate to the framing; do not stack every cue, invent pupil trembling, or add tears without script support.
- Keep performance directions outside `<d>` and integrate their timing into `integrated_multimodal_description` (base modes) or `detailed_description` (Ref2VA). Preserve the selected guide's language, dialogue, speaker-ID, reference, and keyframe rules.
